  # It is tempting to declare each indexed revision as a flake input. Do not:
  # flake inputs are fetched EAGERLY. Measured on this repo, a flake with three
  # nixpkgs inputs whose output referenced only the first still materialised all
  # three (~378 MB of store each). At 13 revisions that is ~4.9 GB fetched
  # before any evaluation can begin, and it grows linearly with every revision
  # added — which would defeat the entire point of a multiverse.
  #
  # Revisions are instead fetched lazily from index/versions.json via
  # builtins.fetchTree, so only the revisions actually touched are ever
  # materialised, and the number of indexed revisions can grow without bound.
